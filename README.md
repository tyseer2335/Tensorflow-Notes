# TensorFlow Notes

Welcome to my TensorFlow notes repository! Here, I've compiled my learning journey with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), an open-source library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

Feel free to download the notebooks and explore. I've tried to summarize concepts in TensorFlow to make your learning experience smoother.

For a more comprehensive version of these notes, visit [this link](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning), where I'm actively learning from.

Also, consider checking out the book [Hands-On Machine Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781098125967/), as it's a valuable resource I'm using to deepen my understanding.
